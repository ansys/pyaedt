Introduction
------------
PyAEDT is part of the larger `PyAnsys <https://docs.pyansys.com>`_
effort to facilitate the use of Ansys technologies directly from Python.

PyAEDT is intended to consolidate and extend all existing
functionalities around scripting for Ansys Electronics Desktop (AEDT)
to allow reuse of existing code, sharing of best practices, and increased
collaboration. PyAEDT is licensed under the `MIT License
<https://github.com/pyansys/PyAEDT/blob/main/LICENSE>`_.

PyAEDT includes functionality for interacting with the following AEDT tools and Ansys products:

- HFSS and HFSS 3D Layout
- Icepak
- Maxwell 2D, Maxwell 3D, and RMxprt
- 2D Extractor and Q3D Extractor
- Mechanical
- Nexxim
- EDB
- Twin Builder

What is PyAEDT?
---------------
PyAEDT is a Python library that interacts directly with the AEDT API
to make scripting simpler for the end user. Its architecture
can be reused for all AEDT 3D products (HFSS, Icepak, Maxwell 3D, and
Q3D Extractor), 2D tools, and Ansys Mechanical. It also provides support for circuit
tools like Nexxim and system simulation tools like Twin Builder. Finally it provides
scripting capabilities in Ansys layout tools like HFSS 3D Layout and EDB. Its class
and method structures simplify operation for the end user while reusing information
as much as possible across the API.

Documentation and issues
------------------------
In addition to installation and usage information, the PyAEDT
documentation provides `API reference <https://aedtdocs.pyansys.com/API/>`_,
`Examples <https://aedtdocs.pyansys.com/examples/index.html>`_, and `Contribute 
<https://aedtdocs.pyansys.com/Resources/Contributing.html>`_ sections.

On the `PyAEDT Issues <https://github.com/pyansys/PyAEDT/issues>`_ page, you can
create issues to submit questions, report bugs, and request new features. To reach
the project support team, email `pyansys.support@ansys.com <pyansys.support@ansys.com>`_.

Dependencies
------------
To run PyAEDT, you must have a local licenced copy of AEDT.
PyAEDT supports AEDT versions 2021 R1 or newer.

Student version
---------------

PyAEDT supports AEDT Student version 2021 R2 and later. For more information, see
`Student Version page <https://www.ansys.com/academic/students/ansys-e
lectronics-desktop-student>`_.


Why PyAEDT?
-----------
A quick and easy approach for automating a simple operation in the 
AEDT UI is to record and reuse a script. However, disadvantages of 
this approach are:

- Recorded code is dirty and difficult to read and understand.
- Recorded scripts are difficult to reuse and adapt.
- Complex coding is required by many global users of AEDT.

The main advantages of PyAEDT are:

- Automatic initialization of all AEDT objects, such as desktop
  objects like the editor, boundaries, and so on
- Error management
- Log management
- Variable management
- Compatibility with IronPython and CPython
- Simplification of complex API syntax using data objects while
  maintaining PEP8 compliance.
- Code reusability across different solvers
- Clear documentation on functions and API
- Unit tests of code to increase quality across different AEDT versions


Example workflow
-----------------
1. Initialize the ``Desktop`` class with the version of AEDT to use.
2. Initialize the application to use within AEDT.


Connect to AEDT from Python IDE
-------------------------------
PyAEDT works both inside AEDT and as a standalone application.
This Python library automatically detects whether it is running
in an IronPython or CPython environment and initializes AEDT accordingly.
PyAEDT also provides advanced error management. Usage examples follow.

Explicit AEDT declaration and error management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    # Launch AEDT 2022 R1 in non-graphical mode

    from pyaedt import Desktop, Circuit
    with Desktop(specified_version="2022.1",
                 non_graphical=False, new_desktop_session=True,
                 close_on_exit=True, student_version=False):
        circuit = Circuit()
        ...
        # Any error here will be caught by Desktop.
        ...

    # Desktop is automatically released here.


Implicit AEDT declaration and error management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    # Launch the latest installed version of AEDT in graphical mode

    from pyaedt import Circuit
    with Circuit(specified_version="2022.1",
                 non_graphical=False) as circuit:
        ...
        # Any error here will be caught by Desktop.
        ...

    # Desktop is automatically released here.


Remote application call
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can make a remote application call on a CPython server
or any Windows client machine.

On a CPython Server:

.. code:: python

    # Launch PyAEDT remote server on CPython

    from pyaedt.common_rpc import pyaedt_service_manager
    pyaedt_service_manager()


On any Windows client machine:

.. code:: python

    from pyaedt.common_rpc import create_session
    cl1 = create_session("server_name")
    cl1.aedt(port=50000, non_graphical=False)
    hfss = Hfss(machine="server_name", port=50000)
    # your code here

Variables
~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from pyaedt.HFSS import HFSS
    with HFSS as hfss:
         hfss["dim"] = "1mm"   # design variable
         hfss["$dim"] = "1mm"  # project variable


Modeler
~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    # Create a box, assign variables, and assign materials.

    from pyaedt.hfss import Hfss
    with Hfss as hfss:
         hfss.modeler.create_box([0, 0, 0], [10, "dim", 10],
                                 "mybox", "aluminum")

This module makes no commercial claim over Ansys whatsoever.
PyAEDT extends the functionality of AEDT by adding
an additional Python interface to AEDT without changing the core
behavior or license of the original software. The use of the
interactive control of PyAEDT requires a legally licensed
local copy of AEDT. For more information about AEDT,
