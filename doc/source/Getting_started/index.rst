Getting started
===============
To run PyAEDT, you must have a licensed copy of Ansys Electronics
Desktop (AEDT) installed.

The Ansys Electronics Desktop (AEDT) is a platform that enables true electronics system design.
`AEDT <https://www.ansys.com/products/electronics>`_ provides access to the Ansys gold-standard
electro-magnetics simulation solutions such as Ansys HFSS,
Ansys Maxwell, Ansys Q3D Extractor, Ansys Siwave, and Ansys Icepak using electrical CAD (ECAD) and
Mechanical CAD (MCAD) workflows.
In addition, it includes direct links to the complete Ansys portfolio of thermal, fluid,
and Mechanical solvers for comprehensive multiphysics analysis.
Tight integration among these solutions provides unprecedented ease of use for setup and
faster resolution of complex simulations for design and optimization.
