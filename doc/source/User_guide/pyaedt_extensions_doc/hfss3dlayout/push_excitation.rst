Push excitation from file
=========================

Push excitation from a CSV file in HFSS 3D Layout.

You can access the extension from the icon created on the **Automation** tab using the Extension Manager.

The following image shows the extension user interface:

  :alt: Push excitation UI


The available arguments are: ``choice`` and ``file_path``.

The ``choice`` parameter is the name of the excitation to push.

You can also launch the extension user interface from the terminal. An example can be found here:


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   ../commandline
