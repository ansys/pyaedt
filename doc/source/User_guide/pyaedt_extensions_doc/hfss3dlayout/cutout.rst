Cutout
======

You can cutout the layout using PyEDB features.

The extension is accessible through the icon created by the Extension Manager in the **Automation** tab.

The following image shows the extension user interface:

.. image:: ../../../_static/extensions/cutout_ui.png
  :width: 800
  :alt: Parametrize Layout UI


The available arguments are: ``choice``, ``signals``, ``reference``,
``expansion_factor``, and ``fix_disjoints``.

The extension user interface can also be launched from the terminal. An example can be found here:


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   ../commandline
