Import schematic
================

Import different schematic files (.asc, .sp, .cir, .qcv) into Circuit.

You can access the extension from the icon created on the **Automation** tab using the Extension Manager.

The following image shows the extension user interface:

.. image:: ../../../_static/extensions/import_schematic_ui.png
  :width: 800
  :alt: Import schematic UI


The available argument is: ``asc_file``.

The ``asc_file`` parameter is the schematic file.

You can also launch the extension user interface from the terminal. An example can be found here:


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
