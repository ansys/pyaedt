Choke designer
==============

You can design a choke in HFSS.

You can access the extension from the icon created on the **Automation** tab using the Extension Manager.

The following image shows the extension user interface:

  :alt: Choke Designer UI


The available argument is: ``choke_config``.

The ``choke_config`` parameter is a dictionary with choke configuration file content. See more information: :ref:`choke-file`.

You can also launch the extension user interface from the terminal. An example can be found here:


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   ../commandline
