Extension Manager
=================

Extensions provide a simplified interface to perform automated workflows in AEDT, they are generally tool-specific and are therefore only accessible given the appropriate context.
In AEDT, you can use the Extension Manager to add or remove extensions.
The `Extension Manager <https://aedt.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/Getting_started/Installation.html#extension-manager>`_ allows the user to install three different types of extensions:

- Custom extensions installable both at project and application level.
- Pre-installed extensions available at project level.
- Open source PyAEDT toolkits available at project level.

The following sections provide further clarification.

You can launch extensions in standalone mode from the console or a Python script.

Pre-installed extensions
========================

Pre-installed extensions are available at project level so they are available for all AEDT applications.
