Extensions
==========

Extensions provide a simplified interface to perform automated workflows in AEDT.
In AEDT, you can use the Extension Manager to add or remove extensions.
For more information, see `Extension Manager <https://aedt.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/Getting_started/Installation.html#extension-manager>`_.

Extensions are generally tool-specific and are therefore only accessible given the appropriate context. The following sections provide further clarification.

You can launch extensions in standalone mode from the console or a Python script.
