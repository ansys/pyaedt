Extension manager
=================

Extensions provide a simplified graphical user interface (GUI) to perform automated workflows in AEDT, they are generally tool-specific and are therefore only accessible given the appropriate context.
In AEDT, you can use the `Extension manager <https://aedt.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/Getting_started/Installation.html#extension-manager>`_ to add or remove extensions.
The Extension manager allows the user to install three different types of extensions:

- **Pre-installed extensions** available at project level.
- **Open source PyAEDT toolkits** available at application level.
- **Custom extensions** installable both at project and application level.

The following sections provide further clarification.

You can launch extensions in standalone mode from the console or a Python script.

Open source toolkits
--------------------

Open source toolkits are available at application level.
They are advanced workflows where backend and frontend are split.
They are also fully documented and tested.

Here are some links to existing toolkits:
- Hfss: `Antenna Wizard <https://github.com/ansys/pyaedt-toolkits-antenna>`_.
- Maxwell 3D: `Magnet Segmentation Wizard <https://github.com/ansys/magnet-segmentation-toolkit>`_.


Custom extensions
-----------------

Custom extensions are custom workflows (Python script) that can be installed both at project and application level.
From the Extension manager select the target destination:

.. image:: ../Resources/toolkit_manager_1.png
  :width: 500
  :alt: PyAEDT toolkit manager 1

Select `Custom` as the extension type.
Provide the path of the Python script containing the workflow.
Enter the extension name. This is the name that appears beneath the button in the Automation tab after a successful installation.

.. image:: ../Resources/my_custom_extension.png
  :width: 500
  :alt: Custom Extension

After the normal completion of the installation a new button appears:

.. image:: ../Resources/my_custom_extension_1.png
  :width: 500
  :alt: Custom Extension 1

The example below is a simple example of custom extension.
The Python script requires a common initial part to define the port and the version of the AEDT session to connect to.

.. code:: python

    import ansys.aedt.core
    import os

    # common part
    if "PYAEDT_SCRIPT_PORT" in os.environ and "PYAEDT_SCRIPT_VERSION" in os.environ:
        port = os.environ["PYAEDT_SCRIPT_PORT"]
        version = os.environ["PYAEDT_SCRIPT_VERSION"]
    else:
        port = 0
        version = "2025.1"

    # your pyaedt script
    app = ansys.aedt.core.Desktop(new_desktop_session=False, specified_version=version, port=port)

    active_project = app.active_project()
    active_design = app.active_design(active_project)

    # no need to hardcode your application since get_pyaedt_app detects it for you
    aedtapp = ansys.aedt.core.get_pyaedt_app(design_name=active_design.GetName(), desktop=app)

    # your workflow
    aedtapp.modeler.create_sphere([0, 0, 0], 20)

    app.release_desktop(False, False)
