About PyAnsys and AEDT
======================

PyAnsys
-------

PyAEDT is part of the larger `PyAnsys <https://docs.pyansys.com>`_
effort to facilitate the use of Ansys technologies directly from Python.

PyAEDT is intended to consolidate and extend all existing
functionalities around scripting for AEDT to allow reuse of existing code,
sharing of best practices, and increased collaboration.


About AEDT
----------

`AEDT <https://www.ansys.com/products/electronics>`_ is a platform that enables true
electronics system design. AEDT provides access to the Ansys gold-standard
electro-magnetics simulation solutions, such as Ansys HFSS, Ansys Maxwell,
Ansys Q3D Extractor, Ansys Siwave, and Ansys Icepak using electrical CAD (ECAD) and
Mechanical CAD (MCAD) workflows.

In addition, AEDT includes direct links to the complete Ansys portfolio of thermal, fluid,
and mechanical solvers for comprehensive multiphysics analysis.
Tight integration among these solutions provides unprecedented ease of use for setup and
faster resolution of complex simulations for design and optimization.

Dependencies
------------
To run PyAEDT, you must have a local licensed copy of AEDT.
PyAEDT supports AEDT versions 2022 R2 and later.

Student version
---------------

PyAEDT supports AEDT Student versions 2022 R2 and later. For more information, see the
`Ansys Electronics Desktop Student  - Free Software Download <https://www.ansys.com/academic/students/ansys-e
lectronics-desktop-student>`_ page on the Ansys website.


Why PyAEDT?
-----------
A quick and easy approach for automating a simple operation in the
AEDT UI is to record and reuse a script. However, here are some disadvantages of
this approach:

- Recorded code is dirty and difficult to read and understand.
- Recorded scripts are difficult to reuse and adapt.
- Complex coding is required by many global users of AEDT.

Here are the main advantages that PyAEDT provides:

- Automatic initialization of all AEDT objects, such as desktop
  objects like the editor, boundaries, and more
- Error management
- Log management
- Variable management
- Compatibility with IronPython (limited) and CPython
- Simplification of complex API syntax using data objects while
  maintaining PEP8 compliance.
- Code reusability across different solvers
- Clear documentation on functions and API
- Unit tests of code to increase quality across different AEDT versions
