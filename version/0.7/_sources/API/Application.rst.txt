Application and solvers
=======================
The PyAEDT API includes classes for different applications available in Ansys Electronics Desktop (AEDT).
You must initialize AEDT to get access to all PyAEDT modules and methods.

Available PyAEDT apps are:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _autosummary

   pyaedt.desktop.Desktop
   pyaedt.hfss.Hfss
   pyaedt.q3d.Q3d
   pyaedt.q3d.Q2d
   pyaedt.maxwell.Maxwell2d
   pyaedt.maxwell.Maxwell3d
   pyaedt.icepak.Icepak
   pyaedt.hfss3dlayout.Hfss3dLayout
   pyaedt.mechanical.Mechanical
   pyaedt.rmxprt.Rmxprt
   pyaedt.circuit.Circuit
   pyaedt.maxwellcircuit.MaxwellCircuit
   pyaedt.emit.Emit
   pyaedt.twinbuilder.TwinBuilder


All other classes and methods are inherited into the app class.
AEDT, which is also referred to as the desktop app, is implicitly launched in any PyAEDT app.
Before accessing a PyAEDT app, the desktop app must be launched and initialized.
The desktop app can be explicitly or implicitly initialized as in the following examples.

Example with ``Desktop`` class explicit initialization:

.. code:: python

    from pyaedt import launch_desktop, Circuit
    d = launch_desktop(specified_version="2023.1",
                       non_graphical=False,
                       new_desktop_session=True,
                       close_on_exit=True,
                       student_version=False):
     circuit = Circuit()
     ...
     # Any error here will be caught by Desktop.
     ...
     d.release_desktop()

Example with ``Desktop`` class implicit initialization:

.. code:: python

    from pyaedt import Circuit
    circuit = Circuit(specified_version="2023.1",
                      non_graphical=False,
                      new_desktop_session=True,
                      close_on_exit=True,
                      student_version=False):
     circuit = Circuit()
     ...
     # Any error here will be caught by Desktop.
     ...
     circuit.release_desktop()
