What is PyAEDT?
---------------
PyAEDT is a Python library that interacts directly with the API for
Ansys Electronics Desktop (AEDT) to make scripting simpler. The architecture
for PyAEDT can be reused for all AEDT 3D products (HFSS, Icepak, Maxwell 3D,
and Q3D Extractor), 2D tools, and Ansys Mechanical. PyAEDT also provides
support for Circuit tools like Nexxim and system simulation tools like
Twin Builder. Finally, PyAEDT provides scripting capabilities in Ansys layout
tools like HFSS 3D Layout and EDB. The PyAEDT class and method structures
simplify operation while reusing information as much as possible across
the API.

To run PyAEDT, you must have a licensed copy of Ansys Electronics
Desktop (AEDT) installed.

The Ansys Electronics Desktop (AEDT) is a platform that enables true electronics system design.
`AEDT <https://www.ansys.com/products/electronics>`_ provides access to the Ansys gold-standard
electro-magnetics simulation solutions such as Ansys HFSS,
Ansys Maxwell, Ansys Q3D Extractor, Ansys Siwave, and Ansys Icepak using electrical CAD (ECAD) and
Mechanical CAD (MCAD) workflows.
In addition, it includes direct links to the complete Ansys portfolio of thermal, fluid,
and Mechanical solvers for comprehensive multiphysics analysis.
Tight integration among these solutions provides unprecedented ease of use for setup and
faster resolution of complex simulations for design and optimization.
