EDB: merge utility
------------------

This example shows how you can use the PyAEDT toolkit to create the WPF (Windows
Presentation Foundation) for Windows usage. It runs a merge between two
EDBs (package on board).

Launch Python script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can launch a Python script in AEDT (**Tools->Run Script**) 
or from the CPython command line.

For this example, four items are downloaded:

- ``package.aedb`` folder contains a package example.
- ``board.aedb`` folder contains a board example.
- ``merge_wizard.py`` file contains the Python script to run.
- ``merge_wizard_settings.json`` file contains the settings.

You can launch the ``merge_wizard.py`` file in AEDT (**Tools->Run Script**)
or from the # CPython command line. This script works only on Windows with UI.

The ``merge_wizard_settings.json`` file contains default settings that can be
used in any other project to automatically load all settings.

You can edit the following lines to launch a Python script from the Python
interpreter:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 45-48

.. code-block:: default


    # from pyaedt.generic.toolkit import launch
    # launch(python_file, specified_version=desktop_version, new_desktop_session=False, autosave=False)
