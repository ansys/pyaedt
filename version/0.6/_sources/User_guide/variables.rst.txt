Variables
=========
PyAEDT provides a simplified interface for getting and setting variables inside a project or a design.
You simply need to initialize a variable as a dictionary key. If you use ``$`` as the prefix 
for the variable name, a project-wide variable is created:

.. code:: python

    from pyaedt import Hfss
    with Hfss as hfss:
         hfss["dim"] = "1mm"   # design variable
         hfss["$dim"] = "1mm"  # project variable

With Variable Manager, you can create advanced equations and manage them through PyAEDT.

While you can set or get the variable value using the app's setter and getter, you can
access the ``variable_manager`` object for a more comprehensive set of functions:

.. code:: python

        >>> hfss["$PrjVar1"] = "2*pi"
        >>> hfss["$PrjVar2"] = "100Hz"
        >>> hfss["$PrjVar3"] = "34 * $PrjVar1/$PrjVar2"
        >>> hfss["$PrjVar3"]
        2.13628300444106
        >>> hfss["$PrjVar3"].value
        2.13628300444106
        hfss.variable_manager["$PrjVar3"].expression
        '34 * $PrjVar1/$PrjVar2'
