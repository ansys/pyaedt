What is PyAEDT?
---------------
PyAEDT is a Python library that interacts directly with the API for
Ansys Electronics Desktop (AEDT) to make scripting simpler. The architecture
for PyAEDT can be reused for all AEDT 3D products (HFSS, Icepak, Maxwell 3D,
and Q3D Extractor), 2D tools, and Ansys Mechanical. PyAEDT also provides
support for Circuit tools like Nexxim and system simulation tools like
Twin Builder. Finally, PyAEDT provides scripting capabilities in Ansys layout
tools like HFSS 3D Layout and EDB. The PyAEDT class and method structures
simplify operation while reusing information as much as possible across
the API.

Install on CPython from PyPI
----------------------------
You can install PyAEDT on CPython 3.7 through 3.10 from PyPI with this command:

.. code:: python

    pip install pyaedt

To install PyAEDT with all extra packages (matplotlib, numpy, pandas, and pyvista),
use this command:

.. code:: python

    pip install pyaedt[full]

You can also install PyAEDT from Conda-Forge with this command:

.. code:: python

    conda install -c conda-forge pyaedt

PyAEDT remains partially compatible with IronPython.
User can still use in the AEDT Framework with IronPython or with CPython.


PyAnsys
-------

PyAEDT is part of the larger `PyAnsys <https://docs.pyansys.com>`_
effort to facilitate the use of Ansys technologies directly from Python.

PyAEDT is intended to consolidate and extend all existing
functionalities around scripting for AEDT to allow reuse of existing code,
sharing of best practices, and increased collaboration.


About AEDT
----------

`AEDT <https://www.ansys.com/products/electronics>`_ is a platform that enables true
electronics system design. AEDT provides access to the Ansys gold-standard
electro-magnetics simulation solutions, such as Ansys HFSS, Ansys Maxwell,
Ansys Q3D Extractor, Ansys Siwave, and Ansys Icepak using electrical CAD (ECAD) and
Mechanical CAD (MCAD) workflows.

In addition, AEDT includes direct links to the complete Ansys portfolio of thermal, fluid,
and mechanical solvers for comprehensive multiphysics analysis.
Tight integration among these solutions provides unprecedented ease of use for setup and
faster resolution of complex simulations for design and optimization.

Documentation and issues
------------------------
Documentation for the latest stable release of PyAEDT is hosted at
`PyAEDT documentation <https://aedt.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/>`_.

In the upper right corner of the documentation's title bar, there is an option
for switching from viewing the documentation for the latest stable release
to viewing the documentation for the development version or previously
released versions.

You can also view or download PyAEDT cheat sheets, which are one-page references
providing syntax rules and commands for using the PyAEDT API and PyEDB API:

<https://github.com/ansys/pyaedt/discussions>`_ page or the `Discussions <https://discuss.ansys.com/>`_
page on the Ansys Developer portal, you can post questions, share ideas, and get community feedback.

To reach the project support team, email `pyansys.core@ansys.com <pyansys.core@ansys.com>`_.

Dependencies
------------
To run PyAEDT, you must have a local licensed copy of AEDT.
PyAEDT supports AEDT versions 2022 R2 and later.

Student version
---------------

PyAEDT supports AEDT Student versions 2022 R2 and later. For more information, see the
`Ansys Electronics Desktop Student  - Free Software Download <https://www.ansys.com/academic/students/ansys-e
lectronics-desktop-student>`_ page on the Ansys website.


Why PyAEDT?
-----------
A quick and easy approach for automating a simple operation in the
AEDT UI is to record and reuse a script. However, here are some disadvantages of
this approach:

- Recorded code is dirty and difficult to read and understand.
- Recorded scripts are difficult to reuse and adapt.
- Complex coding is required by many global users of AEDT.

Here are the main advantages that PyAEDT provides:

- Automatic initialization of all AEDT objects, such as desktop
  objects like the editor, boundaries, and more
- Error management
- Log management
- Variable management
- Compatibility with IronPython (limited) and CPython
- Simplification of complex API syntax using data objects while
  maintaining PEP8 compliance.
- Code reusability across different solvers
- Clear documentation on functions and API
- Unit tests of code to increase quality across different AEDT versions


Example workflow
-----------------
1. Initialize the ``Desktop`` class with the version of AEDT to use.
2. Initialize the application to use within AEDT.


Connect to AEDT from a Python IDE
---------------------------------
PyAEDT works both inside AEDT and as a standalone app.
This Python library automatically detects whether it is running
in an IronPython or CPython environment and initializes AEDT accordingly.
PyAEDT also provides advanced error management. Usage examples follow.

Explicit AEDT declaration and error management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    # Launch AEDT 2023 R1 in non-graphical mode

    from pyaedt import Desktop, Circuit
    with Desktop(specified_version="2023.1",
                 non_graphical=False, new_desktop_session=True,
                 close_on_exit=True, student_version=False):
        circuit = Circuit()
        ...
        # Any error here will be caught by Desktop.
        ...

    # Desktop is automatically released here.


Implicit AEDT declaration and error management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    # Launch the latest installed version of AEDT in graphical mode

    from pyaedt import Circuit
    with Circuit(specified_version="2023.1",
                 non_graphical=False) as circuit:
        ...
        # Any error here will be caught by Desktop.
        ...

    # Desktop is automatically released here.


Remote application call
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can make a remote application call on a CPython server
or any Windows client machine.

On a CPython server:

.. code:: python

    # Launch PyAEDT remote server on CPython

    from pyaedt.common_rpc import pyaedt_service_manager
    pyaedt_service_manager()


On any Windows client machine:

.. code:: python

    from pyaedt.common_rpc import create_session
    cl1 = create_session("server_name")
    cl1.aedt(port=50000, non_graphical=False)
    hfss = Hfss(machine="server_name", port=50000)
    # your code here

Variables
~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from pyaedt.HFSS import HFSS
    with HFSS as hfss:
         hfss["dim"] = "1mm"   # design variable
         hfss["$dim"] = "1mm"  # project variable


Modeler
~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    # Create a box, assign variables, and assign materials.

    from pyaedt.hfss import Hfss
    with Hfss as hfss:
         hfss.modeler.create_box([0, 0, 0], [10, "dim", 10],
                                 "mybox", "aluminum")
