Maxwell Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This series of examples uses PyAEDT to show some Maxwell 2d and 3d end-to-end
workflow. This include model generation, setup, mesh and post-processing.
Examples cover different Maxwell Solution Types (Eddy Current, Magnetostatic, Transient).
Some of the methods requires external python package to run.
